# Engineering Implementation Plan - Twitter MVP

## Overview
This document describes the implementation strategy for the Twitter MVP project, including system architecture, code organization, best practices, and quality standards. It is intended to guide development and be consumable by AI-assisted tools like Claude or v0.dev.

The project is split into two primary parts:
- `frontend/` - implemented with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Relay**.
- `backend/` - implemented with **Nest.js**, **TypeScript**, **GraphQL**, and **SQLite**.

Both parts will use a shared GraphQL schema to enforce type safety and clean API design.
